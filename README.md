# Software Repository - Blind estimation of ensemble width in binaural music recordings using ‘spatiograms’ under simulated anechoic conditions 
This repository consists of the scripts and data intended to replicate the experiments described in the paper "Blind estimation of ensemble width in binaural music recordings using ‘spatiograms’ under simulated anechoic conditions" – accepted for the publication at the AES International Conference on Spatial & Immersive Audio, 2023 August 23-25, Huddersfield, UK.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- [scripts](scripts) - scripts used in the development of the deep learning algorithm: finding hyperparameters, model traning, evaluation, visualization, and statistical calculations

## Dependencies
Software dependencies:
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - a development environment used to implement models
- [VOICEBOX](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html) - a toolbox used to implement the binaural convolver
- [SOFA](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_MO) - a file format for reading, saving, and describing spatially oriented data of acoustic systems.
